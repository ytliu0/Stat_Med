# Visualizing Statistics in Medical Contexts

Several visualizion modules have be created to help students to visualize how the common statistical analysis methods are used in practicing medicine.

## Simple Power Calculation

An example showing how the power of a two-sample test depends on the 
null cutoff and sample sizes.

## Two ROC Examples

These are example programs to randomly draw from a population of some positive 
and some negative for a condition, apply an imperfect screening test, and 
look at the accumulation of true and false positives and negatives. 
The webpages have little sliders to adjust where the diagnostic cutoff 
line was set for the test and what the population prevalence for 
the condition was.

The contents were created in collaboration with Professor Ellen Fireman 
(Deptartment of Statistics) and Professor Michael Weissman (Department of Physics) 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
