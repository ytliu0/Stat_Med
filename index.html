<h1>Visualizing Statistics in Medical Contexts</h1>
    <br />
    
<p>Several visualizion modules have be created to help students to visualize how the common statistical analysis methods are used in practicing medicine.</p>
    
<p>These contents were developed and created by <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/ytliu/" target="_blank">Yuk Tung Liu</a> (Department of Statistics), <a href="https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/fireman" target="_blank">Ellen Fireman</a> (Department of Statistics) and <a href="https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/mbw" target="_blank">Michael Weissman</a> (Department of Physics) at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a>.

<h2>Simple Power Calculation</h2>
    
<p>An example showing how the power of a two-sample test depends on the null cutoff and sample sizes.</p>

     <br />
<h2>Two ROC Examples</h2>
    
<p>These are example programs to randomly draw from a population of some positive and some negative for a condition, apply an imperfect screening test, and look at the accumulation of true and false positives and negatives. The webpages have little sliders to adjust where the diagnostic cutoff line was set for the test and what the population prevalence for the condition was.</p>
